# Data cleaning exercise from Data + Desserts talk at the Flatiron School
Demo exercise for cleaning messy data with Pandas using sales data from a fictious ice cream company. You can view my slides from the presentation [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Y6VUlrlhRUtGmDh1GdsD5w3IaMTPDo3RRhou9sSmpac/edit?usp=sharing).

`sales.csv` is the dataset that I generated, `datagen.py` is the script used to randomly generate the sales dataset, and `explore.ipynb` is the Jupyter Notebook used to walk through the cleaning and analysis.
